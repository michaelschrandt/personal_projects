The Caveman Prophecies (ONLY MICHAEL SCHRANDT'S CODE IS PROVIDED)

Overview
The Caveman Prophecies is a dungeon crawler style game featuring a series of randomly generated maps littered with items and monsters. Touching an enemy during your travels will trigger a battle between your party and a monster party. 

The Battle System
You must select one of your party members (displayed on the left) and one monster (displayed on the right). Once two participants are selected, you may perform a regular or a special attack (by toggling the "Special Attack" button and clicking "Attack"). Be aware, if your attack does not finish off the enemy, it will respond with a regular or special attack against you! Once all monsters are defeated, the battle is won, and you return to the map. If your entire party is defeated on the other hand, the game is over.

Objective
Navigate to the bottom floor of the dungeon by going down ladders to acquire the meteor shard. You must then make your way back to the surface while staying alive.

Tips
